Executive Summary

	Somatic Technologies was founded in December of 2012 and is currently developing CheckIt in-house, a web application with intentions of profit discussed in the rest of the document. CheckIt’s principal mission is to provide the best internal and external scheduling solution for small businesses focused on contracting creative works. We don’t have a main office, but are in the process of pursuing a central location when we begin realizing financial success from our products and services. The purpose of this business plan is to effectively communicate the overall vision and goals of the company to potential investors, employees and founders.

	The process of determining a date to meet with clients for contractors in our target market relies on the availability of the employees being assigned to the client. Scheduling is currently done through calendar sharing, email and text messaging services that aren’t optimized for scheduling with someone outside of the contractors established contacts. These services lead to increased confusion through the entire scheduling process because the client uses outdated methods of communication to request a contractor’s time. The contracting company also has to organize their internal employees to meet the client’s requests for meeting and milestones.  
	
	A client can search a contractor’s calendar and see their availability without compromising the security of both parties’ event data. We do this by displaying the viability of possible event times with a shadow system: the darker the shadow, the more conflicts between parties attending the proposed event. This system transitions seamlessly into scheduling group events within the company to complete contracted work, and efficiently supplements emails as the primary medium for scheduling events. The app lowers the barriers to communication between a contractor and its clients, and relieves the stress associated with searching for relevant information in emails, text messages, or calendar based services.

	We are in the process of developing an Alpha, which is forecasted to be complete and ready for BETA testing by late March. We will then begin marketing it to our primary market through direct contact, trade shows, and social media to gain market awareness. We plan on charging the contractors a premium monthly fee for our service while providing it free to clients. When we get close to our initial launch, we plan on developing a mobile application to complement the service and further increase market penetration. We currently aren’t in the process of seeking investment.

	The two co-founders Blaine Killen (CEO) and Bert Muthalay (COO) currently manage the company and are responsible for executing the overall technological and business related visions for CheckIt and any other in-house or contracted software projects in the future.
