# Somatic Coding Standards
Use two spaces to indent ruby code.

Keep line lengths strictly less than 80 characters.


Use Ruby 1.9 syntax for hash arguments:
    render partial: "navbar"
As opposed to:
    render :partial => "navbar"

Use smacss to organize CSS.

Use haml to write html. 

Use scss to write extensible css.

Use the keywords TODO:, FIXME:, and HACK: to denote todos, broken code, 
and code that should be refactored.

Adhere to Tim Pope's git commit message [guidelines][1].
