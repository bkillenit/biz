People don't care about technology. People care about doing things.
People only care about technology insofar as it can enable them to do things

To make profit as a company, you must create value that is (in aggregate, over
your userbase) greater than the cost to you of generating that value. 
If a user pays for your product, they have _already decided_ that it is "worth
what you charge." 
They validate the fact that you are creating value in excess of your costs;
i.e. you are running a sustainable business.
That value they pay is not a reflection of your product, it is a reflection of
the problem you're solving: what you are actually enabling them to do.

The fundamental challenge of UX design in computing is presenting data.
The fundamental method of solving this challenge is answering the user's

Sacrificing user privacy for profit is a fundamentally short-term tradeoff,
where "short-term" could be ~10 years. 
It is not a sustainable business decision.
