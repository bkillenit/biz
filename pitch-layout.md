anatomy of a pitch
===========


## Company Overview
What is your value proposition?

What unique benefit will you provide to what set of customers to address what
particular need?

(There should be no question about what you do after slide 1.)

## Problem/Opportunity
**TODO: translate this explanation into 4th grade language concepts**
- Let them know the big problem you are solving (existing or emerging)

This is a pain some users don't even fully realize they have, which is why it
can be tough to quantify. Information overload isn't news, but the increasing
fragmentation of delivery mechanisms for our information, including 
_infrastructure and logistics_ information. People need services that can
determine the context that each piece of data needs to be associated with and
deliver that data to them in the right context. We'll refer to this from here
forward as "the context problem."

- Tell them why this problem can now be addressed.

Computers, specifically mobile devices, now have the processing power and
sensory arrays to determine a user's context. Processing power is necessary for
the machine learning any robust solution to the context problem must
incorporate. New sensor arrays allow computers to leverage more powerful data, like
geolocation data.

- How big is the market? Be specific. Don't state the obvious. If the idea is
  a platform play with future opportunities, you can use a second clarifying
  page- slide 2.1.
The size of the market, in the endgame, is every computer user alive, which is
quickly growing to be the entire population of Earth. To be more specific, the
_target market_ for our prototype specifically is tech-savvy iPhone users who
are a) receptive to a privacy/user rights based argument and b) feel 'left out'
by the fact that Google Now, the most cutting-edge system like the one we're
designing, is only on Android. 
## Solution
- What is it? (website, material, etc.)
- How are you going to solve the problem in the specific market you outlined?
- Use broad terms that people understand. You may need a slide 3.1 if your path
  to market is intertwined with other processes. 
## Benefits/Values
- What value do you bring to the table?
- Who benefits from this value?
- How is it delivered?
## Secret Sauce/IP
- You've demonstrated the benefits, now show how you're going to deliver them.
- Technology
- Process
- Team
- Partnerships
- This is not a time to get extremely detailed; avoid jargon.
## Competitive advantage
- Use a competition matrix or feature list to demonstrate your competitive
  advantage.
## Go to Market Strategy
- What hurdles do you have to jump?
- Who is helping you get to market?
- How are you reaching your beta customers?
- Have a plan, not a hope.
## Business Model
- How are you going to make money?
- Include sales pricing, costs, and expected profit margins.
- Be able to explain your assumptions.
- Be ready to discuss risk factors.
## Financial Projections
- Include metrics that drive revenue, expenses, growth, profit, cash balance,
  and headcount lines.
## Summary
- Your key objective on this slide is to solidify the core value proposition of
  your company in words that are memorable and unique to your company.
- How is your audience going to tell your friends what you are?
