anatomy of a pitch
===========


## Company Overview
What is your value proposition?

What unique benefit will you provide to what set of customers to address what
particular need?

(There should be no question about what you do after slide 1.)

## Problem/Opportunity
- Let them know the big problem you are solving (existing or emerging)
- Tell them why this problem can now be addressed.
- How big is the market? Be specific. Don't state the obvious. If the idea is
  a platform play with future opportunities, you can use a second clarifying
  page- slide 2.1.
## Solution
- What is it? (website, material, etc.)
- How are you going to solve the problem in the specific market you outlined?
- Use broad terms that people understand. You may need a slide 3.1 if your path
  to market is intertwined with other processes. 
## Benefits/Values

- Who benefits from this value?
- How is it delivered?
## Secret Sauce/IP
- You've demonstrated the benefits, now show how you're going to deliver them.
- Technology
- Process
- Team
- Partnerships
- This is not a time to get extremely detailed; avoid jargon.
## Competitive advantage
- Use a competition matrix or feature list to demonstrate your competitive
  advantage.
## Go to Market Strategy
- What hurdles do you have to jump?
- Who is helping you get to market?
- How are you reaching your beta customers?

- Include sales pricing, costs, and expected profit margins.

  and headcount lines.
## Summary
- Your key objective on this slide is to solidify the core value proposition of
  your company in words that are memorable and unique to your company.
- How is your audience going to tell your friends what you are?
